This film broke me out of my thinking limbo. Crushed my writer's block that I could connect 3-4 coherent thoughts into a single argument. I don't remember when was the last time I was able to do that.

The Wailing (2016) is about demonic possession. It is about zombie apocalypse type thing. It is about oriental rituals and their idea or devil.

But the core, it is about conversation with God. And this is why this film is very special to me.

What The Wailing is doing is bringing two entities in front of you. One of them is the Devil and one of them is god. You'll have to guess which is which.

Even if you guess it right, you'll understand that neither of the two characters help the protagonist and he had to endure pain nobody deserves. It's haunting.

Filmmaker is asking questions to God.

Why are you silent? Why aren't you guiding or helping ? In this world of deceit and fraud, why do you not help innocent?

Or is it a myth that you exist?

And this is what it makes it very special to me. Because I've done this.

Sitting in Pooja Room at night. Pitch black because everyone else is sleeping. Asking questions to every deity that is present.

People complain that horror have jumpscares and gory. That's not even horror. That is pure disgusting and cheap ways to startle you.

Biggest source of Horror is when your faith in God starts to fade and there is a realization that She may be a myth and doesn't exist.

You have nothing to cling to. There's no one who will come and save you. Your prayers means nothing. There might be no salvation to your pain and agony as promised.

Well, that is pure horror. Na-Hong Jin wrote a masterpiece that brought my mind back from the inaction zone.

This film is not for everyone but man, The Wailing has to be one of the greatest horror that came out in 2010s.
