I built this website as a home for all things me — writing, projects, curiosities, and bookmarks that shape my perspective.

The design and initial codebase were exported from [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev), which gave me a beautiful starting point. From there, I customized, refactored, and extended it to make it feel personal.

The stack includes **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and content powered through **Markdown**. I used **Gray Matter** for frontmatter parsing, **marked** for Markdown rendering, and deployed it via **GitHub Pages**.

This was my first real attempt at shipping something technical from scratch — not just for fun, but to learn how the web works. With AI tools guiding me through unfamiliar territory, I went from zero to a live website I’m proud of.
