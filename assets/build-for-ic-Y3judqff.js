Nan Yu on Lenny’s podcast said that they build Linear for ICs and not for Middle Managers and in all honestly that is a dream for every builder out there. \r
\r
I have not seen this pan out in Indian B2B space in my modest 2 years in the space and I don’t think it will in near future and I think that is one of the biggest reason Linear stands out amongst all B2B products in the world. \r
\r
- Most of the middle managers who initiated the discussion and acted as initial touchpoints for us saw the product from their POV. Very rarely IC POV surfaced in first few discussions and we had to push to understand the actual issue better so as to explain the value. However, almost always discussion of money came up within 1st meeting.\r
\r
- We culturally value money more than time and in the end most middle managers wanted to save organization’s money. Not their fault. Even their superiors must care about that more than enabling ICs to do their work.\r
\r
- Nan said that as product people, we should ‘feel bad how our users felt’. We understood it way later in our journey, mostly when contracts were signed and actual ICs started using the product to see it didn’t solve their problems as they expected and then barrage of feature requests came.\r
\r
- For SMBs, direct connect was founder or someone related to founder and again price took the front seat. One might say that we were unable to showcase value for the money we were asking to pay them and it would be partly right. But it is difficult to empathize with the people who will actually use the product when they come in the picture after the contract starts and it becomes an obligation for them to use it now since their org is paying for it. And some middle manager must be justifying the spend.\r
\r
I work day and night with Indian businesses for enterprise and SMB rollouts for the products I build and everyday I get 5 calls on an average from an actual user who is very far away from the use cases middle managers or procurement teams pitch to us. \r
\r
For me, building for an IC in a B2B setup will always be a dream. A lot of Linkedin/ Twitter post can come and say oh Indians do not pay is a myth. Million of people paying 10 INR each is a big amount. We win the numbers game. \r
\r
But anyone who has ever worked with SMBs or even enterprises in India, price sensitivity is way too high and if you want a contract, you build for people who sign that contract. No wonder some famous tech influencers encourage young kids building B2B SaaS to sell it to US companies.\r
