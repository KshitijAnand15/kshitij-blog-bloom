\r
This was my first role in product management and I got to work across Product, Sales, and Customer Success.\r
\r
Started with [JioWorks](https://www.jioworks.io/) — a work management tool built to solve internal problems. I was brought in to explore taking it to market.\r
\r
- My first experience with Google Analytics and Amplitude came from this product.\r
- We reached 5000 users within 6 months. I worked with designers and developers and also acted as a customer success manager to ensure smooth client adoption.\r
\r
Then came my first **0-1 experience**: [JioCX RCS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQZhHbRZYNVAL6CqQ--BagIBE0mA7kOmy&si=wD9XxgyKpziy8z-M), an initiative under CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service).\r
\r
- I led initial market research, coordinated with Google and other stakeholders, and built the strategy and roadmap.\r
- Led a team of 7 engineers and 3 designers to build both APIs and a self-serve web portal.\r
- Onboarded and supported 13+ businesses in integrating with our APIs. The product reached **3.5 crore messages** in its first full quarter.\r
\r
Lastly, [JioCX EasyPhone](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQZhHbRZYNVAx1WuFSza-IZz5JboVTpXf&si=KdVLTiksBqcd2Q7L) — a 0-1 product focused on retail store employees.\r
\r
- I started with direct user interviews before touching any roadmap or wireframes.\r
- We built an app-first solution to ensure no customer calls were missed.\r
- Worked with a team of 10 engineers and 2 designers, shipping the MVP under tight deadlines. It taught me about user flows, UX debates, and the grit needed to ship.\r
