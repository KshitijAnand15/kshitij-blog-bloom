I thought about ending it, a couple of years back. Riding on the back of a career setback and a heartbreak, it felt my life had no meaning.\r
\r
But I knew I would've reacted the same way Secretariat reacted in the third stanza. I would've changed my mind but was there enough time?\r
\r
I wasn't done here.\r
\r
What I've come to realise is that people underestimate power of optimism and overestimate power of fear and loathing.\r
\r
View from halfway down is not about ending things. It's about hope. It's about the idea that we'll make do. It's not that bad. It's about the regret over the decision.\r
\r
It's said that people who survived suicide attempts by jumping off from somewhere say that midway ie halfway down, they regretted doing it. The view from halfway down is an optimistic view. But it comes too late.\r
\r
Bojack Horseman is not a cartoon show. Believe me. I've not changed my ringtone since I've seen the show.\r
\r
It's about taking ownership of our actions and the consequences of choices we made. But things go down. Life feels easier on the other side. But there is no other side.\r
\r
View from Halfway down is a stark reminder that we are short term thinkers. We embrace fear and pain more easily than hope.\r
\r
If you're reading this anon, I hope you never have to experience the view from halfway down. I hope you have the courage to embrace optimism.\r
\r
Please fight back.\r
